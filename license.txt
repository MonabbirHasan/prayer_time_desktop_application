A contract is a legally enforceable agreement between two or more parties that creates, defines, and governs mutual rights and obligations between them.[1] A contract typically involves the transfer of goods, services, money, or a promise to transfer any of those at a future date. In the event of a breach of contract, the injured party may seek judicial remedies such as damages or rescission.[2] Contract law, the field of the law of obligations concerned with contracts, is based on the principle that agreements must be honoured.[3]

Contract law, like other areas of private law, varies between jurisdictions. The various systems of contract law can broadly be split between common law jurisdictions, civil law jurisdictions, and mixed law jurisdictions which combine elements of both common and civil law. Common law jurisdictions typically require contracts to include consideration in order to be valid, whereas civil and most mixed law jurisdictions solely require a meeting of the minds between the parties.
